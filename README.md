# UR3 Robotic Arm with PyBullet

This project builds a UR3 robotic arm in PyBullet. The input is a monocular camera image, and it utilizes the PPO algorithm from Stable Baselines to train the UR3 robotic arm to complete the task of grasping randomly shaped objects.

## Features

- UR3 robotic arm simulation in PyBullet
- Utilizes monocular camera input
- Training implemented with the PPO algorithm from Stable Baselines
- Task: Grasping randomly shaped objects
